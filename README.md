# PyPoll Analysis

### Overview of Project
Automate the election audit process normally done in Excel for an election held in a Congressional precinct in Colorado.  Voter data from .csv file will be provided to us to utilize with our Python code to see if we can automate a solution that can be put in place, not only for this election but used as a template for future elections.


### Election Audit Results:
- The voters turned out and raised their voices to the tune of 396,711 total votes cast in this election.

- Regarding the breakdown of votes per county, Denver county showed up strong casting 82.8% of the vote (306,055 votes). A distant second is Jefferson county, capturing 10.5% of the votes with their 38,855 votes and Arapahoe county came in last place with 24,801 votes and 6.7% of the total vote. 

- Denver county had the largest number of votes- 306,055 of the 369,711 total votes.

- Diane 'DD' DeGette ROCKED the vote snagging 272,892 (73.8%) of the total 369,711 votes!  Completely, smoking Charles Casper (he's gonna ghost for sure now) Stockham who claimed 85,213 of those 369,711 votes putting him at 23.0% of the vote.
- But Raymon Anthony Doane can NOT be feeling RAD about his showing in this race with an embarrassing 3.1% of the vote, taking home only 11,606 of those 369,711 votes.

*Again, congratulations to Ms. DeGette for her **strong** showing at the polls. Who would have thought her first Congressional race would end with 272,892 of 369,711 total votes! Sweeping the win, 73.8%!*



## Election Audit Summary:  
Tom- Please go back to your team when you present these results and consider that we only looked at 3 counties for this race, but the advantage of Python is the ability to look at large quantities of data with ease.  This script looked only at 2 variables  - candidate and county.  But with a small edit a third variable could easily be added.  Is there a hot button issue on ticket that needs tracked?  We can help.
What about a local election that needs tracked?  We could have variables for mayor and sheriff. Mayor and councilperson?  The possibilities are endless.  Let's talk soon!  Best, Elena Winter
