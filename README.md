# PyPoll Analysis

### Overview of Project
Automate the election audit process normally done in Excel for an election held in a Congressional precinct in Colorado.  Voter data from .csv file will be provided to us to utilize with our Python code to see if we can automate a solution that can be put in place, not only for this election but used as a template for future elections.


### Election Audit Results:
- The voters turned out and raised their voices to the tune of 396,711 total votes cast in this election.

- Regarding the breakdown of votes per county, I only had Arapahoe county turn in their votes.  A total of 24,801 votes and 6.7% of the total vote. So when asked who had the largest county turnout; I dare say it was not Arapahoe county.

- I struggled with this portion of the code and 2 different AskBCS'ers couldn't help me, so I made the decision to turn this is- as is. And discuss with a TA what went awry later, since the rest of the functionality is working.

- Diane 'DD' DeGette ROCKED the vote snagging 272,892 (73.8%) of the total 369,711 votes!  Completely,smoking Charles Casper (he's gonna ghost for sure now) Stockham who claimed 85,213 of those 369,711 votes putting him at 23.0% of the vote.
- But Raymon Anthony Doane can NOT be feeling RAD about his showing in this race with an embarrassing 3.1% of the vote, taking home only 11,606 of those 369,711 votes.

### Again, Congratulations to Ms. DeGette for her strong showing at the polls. Who would have thought her first Congressional race would end with 272,892 of 369,711 total votes! Sweeping the win, 73.8%!



## Election Audit Summary:  
Tom- Please go back to your team when you present these results and consider that we only looked at 3 counties for this race, but the advantage of Python is the ability to look at large quantities of data with ease.  This script looked only at 2 variables  - candidate and county.  But with a small edit a third variable could easily be added.  Is there a hot button issue on ticket that needs tracked?  We can help.
What about a local election that needs tracked?  We could have variables for mayor and sheriff. Mayor and councilperson?  The possibilities are endless.  Let's talk soon!  Best, Elena Winter
